She is respectful of one\'s privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\\n\\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone\'s desire. \\nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa\'s larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It\'s location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \\nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \\"to live like a true Barcelonian\\".  \\n\\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid g\xe9nial!

It\'s a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It\'s located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it\'s rather dark and it\'s easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \\n\\nIt\'s important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers.

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn\'t for us).  We didn\'t even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would\'ve been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs.","id":"SDKUa5","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.838059351213234,"accuracy":4.6929177106079205,"communication":4.376671198533055,"location":3.0960615620017315,"checkIn":4.747527692306437,"value":3.7382992630800347}},{"createdAt":"2014-04-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb5a8","fullname":"Danielle","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/dxmbmocqyzdthqjq6tis.jpg","id":"10549520"},"txt":"Appartement tr\xe9s agr\xe9able et tr\xe9s bien situ\xe9 \xe0 2 pas d\'une station de m\xe9tro et de la place d\'Espagne.\\r\\nToutes les pi\xe8ces sont tr\xe8s agr\xe9ables et les terrasses aussi.\\r\\nSupermarch\xe9 en face et excellente boulangerie au pied de l\'immeuble.\\r\\nImmeuble tr\xe8s calme.\\r\\nPas de cafeti\xe8re \xe9lectrique ni d\'essoreuse \xe0 salade mais l\'\xe9lectrom\xe9nager est top.\\r\\nD\xe9co soign\xe9e.\\r\\nMerci, nous avons pass\xe9 une excellente semaine !

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host\'s guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn\'t use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There\'s wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn\'t watch the few channels we wanted to. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you\'re a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it\'s a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn\'t mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)","id":"oTPZCp","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.1910296786555,"accuracy":4.4562460452718575,"communication":3.3576578049179213,"location":3.5532595677668772,"checkIn":3.893892550366801,"value":3.8251422319026376}},{"createdAt":"2016-04-28T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc83","fullname":"Phan","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/soxgedrvonz2z3q1u1mi.jpg","id":"30073582"},"txt":"The location is great. 7eleven and Wellcome are just in front of your flat.

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\\r\\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes\' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\\r\\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we\'d wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\\r\\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful.

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn\'t feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn\'t the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day\'s exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \\"good morning\\" and \\"good evening\\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn\'t have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira\'s apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.","id":"9txx3Y","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.501442931947224,"accuracy":3.0730651522191574,"communication":3.294549089647585,"location":4.638156411496193,"checkIn":3.8070198477390167,"value":4.928581059184853}},{"createdAt":"2016-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3402e36c59e6164fae52","fullname":"Fl\xe1vio","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/soxgedrvonz2z3q1u1mi.jpg","id":"67209131"},"txt":"Excelente!

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn\'t and they didn\'t, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren\'t. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \\"doctored up\\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it\'s definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \\"this looks nothing like the photos.\\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you\'re paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you\'ll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)","id":"AEax5u","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.220454303717107,"accuracy":3.297982865884966,"communication":4.566135274613176,"location":4.874582292168107,"checkIn":3.2619841155171665,"value":4.892441567270044}},{"createdAt":"2017-12-13T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164faf46","fullname":"Julie","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/qjkthitcs6pbonblobmi.jpg","id":"22888892"},"txt":"Overall this is a great place to stay, walking distance to many casual restaurants and beautiful beach perfect for kids/toddlers. The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\\n\\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won\u2019t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There\u2019s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.","id":"YGdrc0","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.518247792509692,"accuracy":3.3698403633233918,"communication":4.6688941052315265,"location":3.808088687858597,"checkIn":3.597666500547999,"value":4.087430626968375}},{"createdAt":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1ce","fullname":"Vy","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/geec3czlrtp18udpuuyg.jpg","id":"175750558"},"txt":"We had an amazing time.

Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\\n\\n\\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\\"\\n\\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\\" by 32\\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \\"comfortable\\", then this might be the place for you.\\n\\n\\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\\"  -- \\"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\\"\\n\\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \\n\\n\\"This unit is spacious and bright.\\"\\n\\n- Spacious? That\'s a stretch. But bright? You\'re absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \\n\\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana\'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \\n","id":"efGLzq","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.2451582077320067,"accuracy":3.952326005316679,"communication":4.464942661141428,"location":4.42078935329803,"checkIn":3.5467730272939484,"value":4.7996645183150735}},{"createdAt":"2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb471","fullname":"Sue","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/ysrmbblcprixwxwwa62g.jpg","id":"68844759"},"txt":"Beautiful condo.

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can\'t use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \\"we push a couple of buttons\\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn\'t wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn\'t bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I\'m a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.

I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn\'t leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I\'m getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense.","id":"1oEFoi","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.347124640767222,"accuracy":3.9194383021357493,"communication":4.103551228181312,"location":4.707282336870033,"checkIn":4.251977674233655,"value":4.32427497514114}},{"createdAt":"2013-10-10T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164faf39","fullname":"Oleg","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/euxou0azal9iw7vp17vh.jpg","id":"8926090"},"txt":"\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u041a\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430\u044e \u043e\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0451\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0451\u043c, \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u043b\u0443, \u0449\u0435\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e! \u041c\u044b \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u043e\u0445\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0435. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0441 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0437.\\r\\n\\r\\nKubilay.

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\\r\\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i\'m paying the right cab fee. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \\r\\n\\r\\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that\'s all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts\' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don\'t miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \\r\\n\\r\\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he\'s a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam\'s expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \\r\\n\\r\\n ","id":"wBl5xi","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.398885838936424,"accuracy":3.6490797158237864,"communication":4.404075938870065,"location":3.27077478358487,"checkIn":3.601395336833549,"value":3.1143773504951433}},{"createdAt":"2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb329","fullname":"Ramon","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/euxou0azal9iw7vp17vh.jpg","id":"7277980"},"txt":"Alison immediately replied to my booking request and organised for her hubby to meet me as I was checking in late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were very helpful and gave me a bus card to use.

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay.

It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping!

Paul\'s place is awesome! Great space and great location! I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn\'t want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it\'s right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it\'s a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul\'s residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!

Paul, my host, hit it out of the park. The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn\'t your destination, Paul\'s apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia\'s campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul\'s building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn\'t dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul\'s apartment is decorated with an artist\'s eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul\'s kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul\'s space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable.

It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. \\nThe only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. \\nThe kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. \\nThe outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. \\nOverall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time.","id":"Kfl5ZK","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.7216464971795933,"accuracy":3.3725559236307032,"communication":4.946906457440532,"location":3.42204877791676,"checkIn":3.259720070343698,"value":4.008313795709322}},{"createdAt":"2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb2ed","fullname":"Leon William","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/ysrmbblcprixwxwwa62g.jpg","id":"120799515"},"txt":"Unfortunately very disappointed with the overall listing description which does not accurately reflect any similarities to the actual apartment at all.. \'Uptown\' property management state that they offer PLATNIUM Foxtel in all their properties - in this case; the Foxtel box was present but the network connection was not.

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom.

Our flight was delayed and we didn\'t arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn\'t speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn\'t need to.

Lamentablemente, es dif\xedcil llevarse una imagen positiva despu\xe9s de que te roben. El d\xeda antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que hab\xeda de valor, sustra\xeddo. Es una pr\xe1ctica habitual, no fue una excepci\xf3n. La consiguiente desesperaci\xf3n, al estar \\"abandonados\\" en otro pa\xeds, s\xf3lo la conoce quien la padece. Adem\xe1s, no hab\xedamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \\nLo verdaderamente problem\xe1tico no es el robo en s\xed, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el tel\xe9fono, etc\xe9tera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que act\xfaan desde el rencor.\\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo ser\xe1 m\xe1s seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\\nEs recomendable tambi\xe9n, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcion\xf3 el primer d\xeda, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \\nPor otro lado, es dif\xedcil llegar a entender para un espa\xf1ol (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se re\xfana gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la ma\xf1ana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, ten\xedamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy dif\xedcil dormir, pues la gente no ten\xeda ninguna consideraci\xf3n ni civismo en este aspecto.\\nEsto no pretende ser una cr\xedtica destructiva; quiz\xe1 tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relaci\xf3n calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos se\xf1alados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo ser\xe1 bueno.","id":"lPVYLp","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.248283093322654,"accuracy":4.890582943141215,"communication":3.4086098321277825,"location":3.1377098151273226,"checkIn":4.784625710467102,"value":4.395103759468334}},{"createdAt":"2016-08-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3402e36c59e6164fadec","fullname":"M\xe9lanie","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/soxgedrvonz2z3q1u1mi.jpg","id":"55254902"},"txt":"Un tr\xe8s bon accueil de la part de Margarida.

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy\'s apartment and we wish we could return.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We\'re glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute\'s notice. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don\'t pass this place up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \\r\\n\\r\\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price.

I call it hideaway because the apt. faces the back of the building and you hear nothing except birds chirping, no street noise. The apartment is very small: essentially the large, airy and lovely bedroom you see in the photo and then a tiny kitchen and bathroom. But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day. She met the plumber there and dealt with the situation, so it was no trouble at all for us.

This is our first AirB&B rental and we were pleasantly surprised! The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn\'t bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn\'t meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended.","id":"wy9dYb","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.3315333220493195,"accuracy":4.940517666674904,"communication":3.083430730392132,"location":3.42521709635462,"checkIn":4.957073157890049,"value":4.914629990228182}},{"createdAt":"2017-01-26T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb2de","fullname":"Deirdre","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/dxmbmocqyzdthqjq6tis.jpg","id":"6681633"},"txt":"I was struck upon entering the condo by the immediately visible beautiful view of the Pacific from the lanai.

Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not.

We were specifically looking for a quiet place not far from the center.  And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia\'s apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It\'s located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it\'s a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it\'s absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.

Patricia was very welcoming and offered to order a taxi to pick us up at the airport. I love the neighborhood of Gracia. There are many interesting shops, restaurants and bars, not to mention 4 pla\xe7as and 2 great food markets. It is a quick metro ride to the rest of the city, but with a lot to offer in itself! To sum up, a perfectly located place to explore Barcelona! I recommend anyone to stay here.","id":"jwpjiN","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.9160318479306757,"accuracy":3.719880670737652,"communication":3.8961439987807687,"location":4.421313192216361,"checkIn":4.578155768424695,"value":3.4867032185461597}},{"createdAt":"2014-06-17T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1e0","fullname":"Amy","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/ysrmbblcprixwxwwa62g.jpg","id":"11703028"},"txt":"Patricia and Jorge are extremely accommodating and helpful.

Being wooden and bare (the floorboards) we were hearing (and feeling the vibrations of) the neighbours very clearly and they stayed up till around 2am every night we were there.","id":"qMKbYa","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.454692755995138,"accuracy":4.66484001208887,"communication":3.1937063856796075,"location":4.32408032255337,"checkIn":3.6230263691946214,"value":4.0454400508485335}}],"likedByUsers":[],"labels":["Towers","Ski","Castles","Tropical"],"stayDetails":{"guests":3,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bathrooms":1}},{"name":"ECONOMIC APARTMENT","type":"Entire home/apt","imgUrls":["http://res.cloudinary.com/dmtlr2viw/image/upload/v1663436872/i3jblqgpdttpwvshbffo.jpg","http://res.cloudinary.com/dmtlr2viw/image/upload/v1663436390/om97cgufeacwlric2r5w.jpg","http://res.cloudinary.com/dmtlr2viw/image/upload/v1663436368/noebywqae4x0u42srsv3.jpg","http://res.cloudinary.com/dmtlr2viw/image/upload/v1663436978/mhqf1tttzqr33ecrrwb2.jpg","http://res.cloudinary.com/dmtlr2viw/image/upload/v1663437036/a4pijdxx1kiebg7r6dxg.jpg"],"price":269,"summary":"Welcome to your home just in the heart of Istanbul... :)","amenities":["TV","Cable TV","Internet","Wifi","Kitchen","Smoking allowed","Doorman","Elevator","Buzzer/wireless intercom","Heating","Family/kid friendly","Suitable for events","First aid kit","Safety card","Fire extinguisher","Essentials","Shampoo"],"roomType":"Entire home/apt","host":{"_id":"622f3405e36c59e6164fb893","fullname":"Atilla","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/dxmbmocqyzdthqjq6tis.jpg","isSuperHost":true},"loc":{"country":"Turkey","countryCode":"TR","city":"Istanbul","address":"Beyo\u011flu, \u0130stanbul, Turkey","lat":28.98387,"lng":41.03315},"reviews":[{"createdAt":"2014-01-03T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb08e","fullname":"Marijana","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/qjkthitcs6pbonblobmi.jpg","id":"10386201"},"txt":"Great place, near  Taksim Square, about 10 minutes from it by walking.

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn\'t working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.\\n\\nJust to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn\'t use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that\'s just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn\'t have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.\\n\\nThe noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.\\n\\nThe location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it\'s very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it\'s near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you\'ll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you\'ll find in Maui.  There\'s also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).\\n\\nTo summarize, the condo was more \\"rustic\\" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you\'d likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.","id":"KzJxLX","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.354391029367542,"accuracy":4.083119240479995,"communication":4.569488748071703,"location":3.2163098696275476,"checkIn":4.263214695166967,"value":4.810501901199441}},{"createdAt":"2017-09-15T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3405e36c59e6164fb7d1","fullname":"International Theatrical","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/euxou0azal9iw7vp17vh.jpg","id":"24734634"},"txt":"Wonderful host great location","id":"etHEkH","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.6122176285726235,"accuracy":4.896738100977028,"communication":3.46438706656094,"location":3.4256691930547487,"checkIn":3.171799206119776,"value":3.218681626473035}},{"createdAt":"2017-10-11T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3405e36c59e6164fb867","fullname":"Michael","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/r5lz8rqyjsaruo0lanlw.jpg","id":"78286024"},"txt":"Jennifer\'s place has everything you need in the perfect location.

Sophie has decorated it tastefully and with a lot of thought, providing a lovely selection of art and deign oriented coffee table books for you to peruse. \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation wise it\u2019s perfect, being a 5 min walk from the Sagrada Familia and there are a number of nice bars and restaurants in the direct vicinity of the apartment. It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its\u2019s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll\u2019s home after a night of eating and drinking. \\r\\n \\r\\nSophie herself could not have been more accommodating.

The apartment is cute and stocked with everything you need to actually live in it, which I appreciated - good kitchen. Roberta was responsive and accessible.

It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. \\n\\nOkay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. \\n\\nOn a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we\'re on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.\\n\\nAll and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.\\n\\nThank you Evan & Maria and good luck with the baby ...\\n\\nyours truly,\\n\\nThe De Haans","id":"xpIASk","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.8270208065418334,"accuracy":4.387464890643269,"communication":3.4859320879360713,"location":4.115480901102799,"checkIn":3.9455949756739983,"value":4.300611572090457}},{"createdAt":"2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb581","fullname":"Katherine","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/soxgedrvonz2z3q1u1mi.jpg","id":"19127597"},"txt":"Evan and Maria were accommodating with my check in and check out.

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos: impeccably clean, modern, updated and cozy.  The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and provided a restful nights sleep after long days exploring the city.  Our adult daughter slept on the futon, and she was in heaven!  There were extra pillows, sheets and a comforter in the closet, and I\'m not exaggerating when I say that she was more comfortable here than in the hotel room we stayed at during our first half of our trip.  The apartment had everything we needed: dishes, Keurig coffee and coffee maker (my #1 priority!), iron, hair dryer and much, much more!  There was a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that I thoroughly enjoyed and a jar full of Hershey\'s kisses (which we ate entirely too many of)!  Evan and Maria thought of everything; there is even an iPhone charger to use!  For NYC, it was very quiet and peaceful, which came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise to us.  The location can\'t be beat, close to great restaurants, parks,  & subways.  I\'m sure I\'m forgetting something, but let me end by saying that this apartment is so great that I want to live in it!  In fact, our daughter hopes to relocate to the city soon, and she took note of just how well Evan and Maria utilized the space and all the most wonderful details.  Well done.

And of course the roof top terrace is an excellent place to relax and enjoy wine, or beer, after a day of exploring the steep streets and many steps of Porto. We will most definitely be returning. Thank you C\xe1tia and David.","id":"7TdEhu","moreRate":{"cleanliness":4.843578957148186,"accuracy":4.991554462142409,"communication":3.597835385782453,"location":4.957289286797088,"checkIn":3.476539025966446,"value":3.7772559272496546}},{"createdAt":"2016-07-04T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3407e36c59e6164fbee7","fullname":"Adrian","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/euxou0azal9iw7vp17vh.jpg","id":"8849176"},"txt":"El apartamento era igual que en las fotos.

A working fridge was one of my must-have items, but was disappointed to find the fridge seal was extremely mouldy, including certain parts inside. I guess my biggest surprise is that this room is actually a room within an apartment which is subdivided into five rooms. There is no window as understood through other reviews and confirmation from Stephen, so won\'t be suitable for those who are claustrophobic, and you\'ll have to rely entirely on the air conditioning for fresh air. There is, however, a pseudo-window slot that is open to the corridor in the common area. Would have made the space much more homey if there were a small curtain covering this pseudo-window space since it is half-covered by a file folder and you can still see the dirty metal guard and the sheet of dirty plastic with a hole for the air cond. unit exhaust. I was much taken aback by this after seeing the more \\"modern\\" amenities, such as the cupboards and bathroom tiles. Another thing that bothered me was the absence of hooks for clothing, except for the three tiny adhesive hooks in the bathroom (but since the shower is in the same space as the toilet, one cannot use these tiny hooks for dry clothing anyways) and the bar on the glass door (but I didn\'t want to hang too much on it since the bar is against a glass door). Hence, the only chair in the space is hijacked by my clothes. So if you plan to stay there more than a week, you might find it inconvenient. \\n\\nAll in all, if you don\'t have a keen eye for cleanliness, you will like this place for its proximity to amenities and quick response from host.\\n\\nHint: If you arrive at the building by taxi, give the taxi driver the Wood Road address, but then you\'ll have to walk to the Heard Street entrance to enter the building since the security code doesn\'t work on the Wood Road entrance.","id":"c6rlE7","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.0505526225859865,"accuracy":4.847564469204194,"communication":3.550203483934074,"location":4.078282147720928,"checkIn":4.531736620147557,"value":4.58009851378427}},{"createdAt":"2018-04-30T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb2ab","fullname":"Egan","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/r5lz8rqyjsaruo0lanlw.jpg","id":"4303794"},"txt":"Thanks Stephen for the stay, its been great.","id":"q1mhfs","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.268583634417637,"accuracy":3.933555047038398,"communication":3.997191945780731,"location":4.0304969653736915,"checkIn":4.603893802532939,"value":4.921638186392292}},{"createdAt":"2018-05-07T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc9b","fullname":"Elis","imgUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dp32ucj0y/image/upload/v1674657025/ykdkmw4dzdbd9llcx8kn.jpg","id":"97748974"},"txt":"The location was good and there is convenient store located right below the apartment!

The only thing we like to mention for the apartment that is located in a really nice area of Sydney, is that you can only reach it by bus (5 stops) - so there is no tram nearby. The last bus we were able to find to the direction of the apartment left the city at 8:30 pm. That was sometimes a little bit early for us and we had to take an uber (which costs around 20AUD). Everything else was really awesome and we can recommend to stay there for sure.

O layout da casa assemelha-se \xe0 um hostel, o quarto que eu fiquei tem tamanho excelente para 4 pessoas e tem ar condicionado, o que faz muita diferen\xe7a com o calor que est\xe1 no Rio de Janeiro. Existem 4 banheiros, que s\xe3o suficientes para o n\xfamero de pessoas que cabem na casa, entretanto durante todos os dias que passei l\xe1, o banheiro n\xe3o foi limpo nenhuma vez, por sorte os h\xf3spedes estavam mantendo-o em condi\xe7\xf5es de uso, mas seria importante limpar o banheiro de vez em quando. \\r\\nOutro ponto importante \xe9 que os quartos s\xe3o ligados por uma porta que n\xe3o tem fechadura e \xe9 bem fina, ou seja, a privacidade n\xe3o \xe9 garantida e o barulho de um quarto pode ser ouvido perfeitamente no outro.\\r\\nO pre\xe7o \xe9 justo pelo que \xe9 oferecido, seria importante apenas melhorar a limpeza e verificar se \xe9 poss\xedvel fechar a comunica\xe7\xe3o dos quartos.","id":"t1PIyk","moreRate":{"cleanliness":3.8053960917617973,"accuracy":4.250199612032487,"communication":3.0797461989743384,"location":4.4396934681140126,"checkIn":4.215144911764483,"value":4.662182084329492}}],"likedByUsers":[],"labels":["Parks","Cabins","Towers","Home"],"stayDetails":{"guests":8,"bedrooms":1,"beds":1,"bathrooms":4}}]')}},a={};function
